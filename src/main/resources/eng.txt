A controlled explosion has been carried out at Old Trafford after a suspect package was found ahead of Manchester United's match against Bournemouth.
Two stands - the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand and the Stretford End - were evacuated before the final game of the season and sniffer dogs brought in.
Kick-off, due at 15:00 BST, was delayed and shortly afterwards the match was abandoned on police advice.
A bomb disposal team carried out the explosion at about 16:30 BST.
Just under two hours earlier, an "operation red code" alert had been heard over the public address system, and the players who were warming up had left the field.
Fans were then advised that, because of "the discovery of a suspect package in the north-west quadrant of the ground, the match has been abandoned for today on police advice".
Supporters who were still in the ground were advised to stay in their seats while the forecourt was cleared of fans who had been in the two stands that were evacuated.
While the evacuation was occurring, Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward spoke to Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore about the game being called off, BBC Sport's football correspondent Phil McNulty revealed.
The Premier League has announced it is looking to rearrange the match as soon as possible.
